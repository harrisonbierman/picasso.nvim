1. language specific colors - autochange scheme based on file type
1. project specific colors - autochange scheme based on root project directory
1. preview window - a small window that show what the scheme would look like before it is applied.
it is possible to have buffer specific schemes for this purpose
1. auto install all schemes - button that auto installs all compatable colorschemes for neovim
1. if not out install, have a list of all the avaliable and a preview for each one (without actually loading it in)
and then if you like it, you can select it and install
